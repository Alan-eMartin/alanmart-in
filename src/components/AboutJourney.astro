      <p class="text-lg font-light">
        I’m a software developer focused on building performant, accessible, and
        thoughtfully designed web applications. I’ve worked across the stack at
        startups such as Xanadu, Tablz, Ambassador AI, and Fülhaus, leading
        projects that improve content discovery, streamline workflows, and
        create better user experiences.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg font-light">
        Before working in tech, I spent several years in fine dining kitchens
        such as Canoe in Toronto, where I learned the value of precision,
        collaboration, and continuous improvement. Those same principles guide
        how I write code and build products today.
